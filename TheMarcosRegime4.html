      <h2>The Martial Law Era</h2>
      <p class="title">The Darkest Age of the Philippines</p>
      <p class="par">Exactly at 7:17 PM on September 23, 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos appeared on National TV to announce he had declared Martial Law in the Philippines. He claimed that it was the last resort against the alleged communist insurgency threats of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and the movement of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). The Armed Forces of the Philippines had absolute military control for 14 years. This resulted to extensive violations of human rights.</p>

      <h2>The People Power Revolution</h2>
      <p class="title">Call for Revolution</p>
      <p class="par">The People Power Revolution is a time of hope for many. It was known as a "bloodless revolution," as millions of Filipinos exhibited the spirit of movement through non-violent demonstrations. Many also referred to this event as the "Yellow Revolution" because of the presence of yellow ribbons as a reference to the song "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree." The events of February 25, 1986, altered the not only the course of our nation’s history, but also the lives of many. This event showcased the remarkable nationalism of the Filipino people to the world. It heralded an period of peace. Over the times, we've continued to flash back this momentous occasion by recognizing the offerings of all those who fought the dictatorship.</p>
